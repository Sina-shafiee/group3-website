### Website Template for a tech company named MOONWEB.

#### our strategy to made this website:
> we made main branch and on top of that made a branch called develop to start working on this project and then every team member cloned and created new own branch from develop branch and sended 4 pull requests to develop branch <br>
> we created a review checkpoint for incoming pull requests to develop and main branch. <br>
> everyone in order to merge their branch to develop was forced to take at least 2 approve form other members.(1approve from creator of commit + 2 approve from team = 3 approve)

#### Great job. thanks to the all team members:
